Recreate the game WORDLE using Python.

You can see how to play WORDLE at https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/ where you have to guess the WORDLE (an unknown hidden 5-letter word). The rules as taken from the website are:

Guess the WORDLE in 6 tries.
Each guess must be a valid 5 letter word. Hit the enter button to submit.
After each guess, the color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word.
Examples WEARY The letter W is in the word and in the correct spot. PILLS The letter I is in the word but in the wrong spot. VAGUE The letter U is not in the word in any spot. A new WORDLE will be available each day!

The goal is to write a Python program that will enable someone to play Wordle.

A file containing all the words in the UK Scrabble dictionary is included as a resource to see valid 5-letter words, this is named as dict.txt.
